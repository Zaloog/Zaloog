## About Me
I am an IT Business Analyst from Cologne, Germany.
With my engineering background and my passion for developing clean and tested code, I enjoy working on
innovative projects to create solutions for end users which have a real impact.
I want to make an impact with my work and projects to make the world a better place.

I contribute to open-source software and also maintain some CLI developer tools and libraries myself.
As a self-driven learner, I deepen my expertise by building projects to explore and master new technologies and frameworks.
Therefore most of my projects are the result of my desire to learn more about a specific technology
or framework.

Currently I am also exploring Rust, with maturin/PyO3 for Python-Rust FFI integrations.
